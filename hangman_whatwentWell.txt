What went well?

- We finally did some technical work as a group. This is our 3rd week since we have been assigned to this group and this is our first time coding together from scratch. Very fun!

What didn't go so well?

- We spend an entire day creating non-technical powerpoints on the same topic. We also spent an entire day listening to the same presentation 17 times. I think they could have given us more than an hour to work on this exercise. Why are algo hour and technical exercises rushed compared to presentation times?

What could have been better?
- I hope we can stop making presentations on making algorithm and flowcharts.
